			<h1>About</h1>
			<p>I code in order to find and understand patterns in data that quantify geologic structures.</p>
			<p>Right now, I'm finishing work that aims to compare observations with randomness, using data that locate discrete structures along a line in space or time. Mostly to satisfy my own curiosity, I wrote Matlab code that lets you interrogate data using spectral and correlation tools. I added a GUI, and now it's an app that runs on Mac and PC.</p>
			<p>I invite you to use the app, and to share what you find: <em><a href="https://github.com/marrett/CorrelationCount">CorrCount</a></em></p>
