			<h1>About</h1>
			<p>I code in order to find and understand patterns in data that quantify geologic structures.</p>
			<p>Right now, I'm finishing work that aims to compare observations with randomness, using data that locate discrete structures along a line in space or time. Mostly for my own benefit, I wrote Matlab code that lets you interrogate your own data using the same tools, so I created an app that runs on Mac and PC.</p>
			<p>I invite you to use the app, and to share what you find:</p>
